        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>2nd year aspiring IT student with too many interests and not enough time. A simple man who constantly seeks thrill and excitement in our everyday lives and is willing to try just about anything new for the first time just to see if I would enjoy or hate it. Often times when I take interest in something I found fun or entertaining I would hyperfixate on it for quite some time, leaving many of my other interests and hobbies on hold (including my academics at times), until I am satisfied or no longer feel that what I took interest in was fun.
        
        My greastest strengths are my time management in the sense that I have good judgement on how long something will take to finish and when I should start working on it at the latest, allowing to me ensure that I will always be able to finish my tasks on time even if it's just 1 minute before the deadline. Other characteristics of mine that I would consider my strengths is my self-awareness, quick decision making, and ability to learn something when I'm truly interested in it. My greatest weakness would definitely be my overly laid back attitude due to the confidence that I have the urgent and important things figured and planned out for the long term. My inability to be properly formal when making conversations with others is also a huge problem for me and therefor I'd much prefer to stay quiet when confronted by someone I'm not yet close with.</p>
